# Transifex Public API

Example use of an un-official [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) API that I prepared in _about 30 minutes_. I used Bootstrap 4 ([soon to be released](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/)) and jQuery 2 along with Handlebars for templating. JSON data is temporarily stored in the browser (sessionStorage). For CORS I rely on [Yahoo Query Language (YQL)](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/).

FYI, as the API is not documented and unofficial, it might stop working anytime.
